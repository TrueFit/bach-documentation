title: Overview

This library brings redux connectivity to components composed with [@truefit/bach](https://github.com/truefit/bach) allowing you to add actions and selectors directly in your enhancer chain, rather than needing an extra HOC for connect.

_This library is based on the react-redux hooks found in the current alpha release, so you will need to be using that version as well (https://react-redux.js.org/next/api/hooks)_
