This library brings redux connectivity to components composed with [@truefit/bach](https://github.com/truefit/bach) allowing you to add actions and selectors directly in your enhancer chain, rather than needing an extra HOC for connect.

_This library is based on the react-redux hooks found in the current 7.1 release (and higher), so you will need to be using that version as well_

## Enhancer Index
